BTN7030-Arduino-Shield

NovalithICTM Lite Arduino Shield BTN7030-1EPA

BTN7030-1EPA – Arduino Shield (Smart integrated half-bridge)

The purpose of this Arduino Shield is to provide very simple demo code and interfaces to the BTN7030-1EPA device via C++ objects. 
We hope you will enjoy using NovalithICTM Lite smart half-bridges with integrated protection and diagnostic features. 

For using this board, you will need:

•	12V DC power supply with sufficient load current capability (20A)

•	Half-bridge and Full-Bridge configuration

•	4 cables - use 4mm² banana plugs

•	A microcontroller evaluation board with Infineon XMC1100 starter kit (Arduino compatible) or Arduino Uno Board

•	A firmware for your microcontroller evaluation board.

•	Micro-USB cable to upload the code and to provide supply voltage (5 V) from the PC to the board.
